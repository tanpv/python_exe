    "# Note : In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.\n",
    "# It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\n",
    "# For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.\n",
